## Overview

This interactive game teaches students (grades 8-12) how artificial intelligence **really** works - beyond the hype! Through fun challenges, students discover:

- 🧠 **Human Brain vs AI** - Compare the amazing human brain to artificial neural networks
- 🕸️ **Neural Networks** - Explore layers, nodes, and how AI "learns" by adjusting weights
- 🎯 **Pattern Recognition** - The SECRET behind all AI magic
- ⚡ **AI Pipelines** - Input → Process → Find Patterns → Output

## Key Learning Objectives

1. AI doesn't truly "think" or "understand" - it finds patterns in data
2. The human brain is incredibly efficient (20 watts vs thousands for AI)
3. AI needs millions of examples to learn; humans need just a few
4. Neural networks learn by adjusting "weights" on connections
5. AI lacks common sense because it hasn't experienced the real world
